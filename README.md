# Hoax Detection on Social Media with CNN and SVM

## About the Project
This is my Final Project course research for completing my bachelor study. The research is about hoax detection on social media (Twitter) with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) dan Support Vector Machine (SVM). </br></br>
Tools: Google Spreadsheet, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook </br>
Programming language: Python

## Dataset
The data is crawled from Twitter, which is based on keywords related to predetermined news topics in this study regarding Ferdy Sambo and the Kanjuruhan Tragedy. The data that has been crawled is put together, known as a dataset. The total data is 25,325, consisting of 2,699 Kanjuruhan Tragedy news and 22,626 Ferdy Sambo news.
